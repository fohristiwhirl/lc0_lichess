Simple Lc0 runner for Lichess API - runs Lc0 at a specified number of nodes, ignoring the time control. The config file should be fairly self explanatory. Rename it `config.json` to actually use it.

A note about the book: because this script is very simple, and has no actual chess knowledge, there's no way to use a PGN book. The book is therefore in a more stupid format.
