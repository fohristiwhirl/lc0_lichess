Simple Lc0 runner for Lichess API. Either:

* Runs at a specified node count, ignoring time control, or
* Uses the default time manager, if no node count is set.

The config file should be fairly self explanatory. Rename it `config.json` to actually use it.

A note about the book: because this script is very simple, and has no actual chess knowledge, there's no way to use a PGN book. The book is therefore in a more stupid format. But you can delete it entirely, if you like.
